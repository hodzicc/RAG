# RAG Chatbot using Llama2

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Llama2. The chatbot is designed to answer questions related to the C programming language. It utilizes a RAG system that retrieves information from a book on C programming, enabling it to provide responses based on the content of the book.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Response**: Leverages ChromaDB to fetch relevant information from a digital copy of a C programming book.
- **LLaMA2 Integration**: Uses the powerful Llama2 model for generating responses.
- **Web Interface**: Includes a simple web interface for interactive chat sessions.
- **Deployment Ready**: Ready to deploy with ngrok integration for easy access to the web interface.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Google Colab (for initial setup and execution)
- An ngrok account for deploying the web interface publicly

## Installation
- Upload the notebook to Google Colab.
- Mount your Google Drive to access the C programming book
- Run the notebook cells to install required packages and set up the environment.
